# Using Recurrent Neural Network to differentiate noise from underfit #
first cheekpoint of the project. 
This repository includes 3 parts:
1. ###  running simulation on the reduce two-step task () of two RL models: ###
> Hybrid model-based model-free agent  
> Noisy win-stay-loss-shift
2. ###  Fitting 3 models on the behavior measured during simulation ###
> Hybrid model-based model-free agent fit   
> logistic regression fit 
> RNN fit 
3. ### Predicting the behavior measured during simulation of withheld blocks ###
> Hybrid model-based model-free agent fit   
> logistic regression fit 
> RNN fit
