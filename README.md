## Background 
Theory-driven computational modeling allows estimation of latent cognitive and neural variables.  
Nonetheless, studies have found that computational models can systematically fail to describe some individuals. 
Presumably two factors contribute to this shortcoming: 
1. Higher internal noise (stochasticity in behavior).
2. Deployment of different model (unknown to the researcher).
However, when measuring behavior of individuals on cognitive task, 
these two factors are entangled and therefore hard to dissociate. 
Here we examine (in-silico) the use of advances in machine-learning as tool to  disentangled this two factors.  



In this project we investigate the use of data-driven machine learning algorithm to identify
the generative decision-making model. Our experiment and analysis shows that recurrent neural network can be used to dissociate noise
