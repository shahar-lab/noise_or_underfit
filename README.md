# Using Recurrent Neural Network to differentiate noise from underfit #
---------------
First cheekpoint of the project  
All code can be run from the main_simulation_and_fit notebook

---------------
This repository includes 3 parts:
###  1. Running simulation on the reduce two-step task () of two RL models: ###
> Hybrid model-based model-free agent  
> Noisy win-stay-loss-shift
###  2. Fitting 3 models on the behavior measured during simulation ###
> Hybrid model-based model-free agent   
> logistic regression   
> RNN  
### 3. Predicting the behavior measured during simulation of withheld blocks with the fitted models ###
> Hybrid model-based model-free agent    
> logistic regression   
> RNN   
### Requirements ###
